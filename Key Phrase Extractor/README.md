# **Keyphrase Extraction Model**

## **Introduction**  
Keyphrase extraction is a critical task in natural language processing, especially for academic and scientific texts, where identifying key concepts can significantly enhance learning and comprehension. The development of a **fine-tuned SciBERT-based keyphrase extraction model** aims to provide students with a tool to efficiently extract key ideas from lengthy academic content. 

This model complements a suite of NLP tools designed to assist students in academic learning, such as summarization, question generation, and content indexing. By automating the extraction of keyphrases, this tool empowers students to focus on critical concepts, enhancing their overall learning experience.

## **Development Process**  

### **1. Initial Exploration**  
The journey began with a Seq2Seq model for keyphrase extraction. While this approach showed promise, challenges such as irrelevant outputs, vocabulary management issues, and limited contextual accuracy prompted a transition to alternative methods like KeyBERT. KeyBERT, based on static embeddings, provided better results but lacked adaptability to academic tasks.

### **2. Final Approach: SciBERT**  
To address these challenges, the final model leveraged **SciBERT**, a domain-specific transformer model pretrained on scientific text. SciBERT was fine-tuned for token classification using the **SemEval-2010 dataset**, which includes BIO-tagged data (`B`, `I`, `O`) for keyphrase extraction. This approach significantly improved contextual accuracy and relevance.

### **Example 1**  
- **Input:**  
  "Deep learning is a key component of modern artificial intelligence."  
- **Extracted Keyphrases:**  
  ["deep learning", "artificial intelligence", "key component"]

### **Example 2**  
- **Input:**  
  "It’s a software program that manages all other application programs in a computer. The OS acts as a bridge between hardware and software, and allows users to interact with the computer."  
- **Extracted Keyphrases:**  
  ["software program", "operating system", "hardware", "computer"]

### **Analysis of Results**

#### 1. **Contextual Accuracy**  
- The model identifies relevant terms in the input, ensuring domain-specific accuracy.  
- For **Example 2**, phrases like “software program” and “operating system” are essential to the description, while irrelevant terms are excluded.

#### 2. **Precision in Keyphrases**  
- The extracted phrases are concise and relevant, avoiding repetition or unnecessary details.  
- **Example 2** highlights the critical concepts (“software program”, “operating system”) without overwhelming the output with less critical terms.

#### 3. **Fluency in Extraction**  
- Keyphrases like “deep learning” and “software program” are extracted as complete, coherent phrases.  
- The output ensures readability and avoids fragmented or incomplete terms.
