# **Academic Text NLP Tools**  

## **Project Overview**  
This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools designed to make academic resources more accessible and easier to comprehend. These tools address specific challenges students face in understanding complex academic texts, especially in multilingual contexts.  

The tools developed in this project include:  
1. **Translation Model**: Translates English academic texts into Telugu.  
2. **Key Phrase Extraction**: Identifies critical terms and concepts in texts.  
3. **Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of lengthy academic passages.  
4. **Question Generation**: Creates questions for quizzes or self-assessment.  
5. **Word Assistance Tool**: Extracts difficult words, provides meanings, and suggests synonyms to simplify academic content.  

Each tool is contained in its respective folder, with dedicated code and documentation.

## **Translation Model**  
The **Translation Model** leverages the mBART architecture, fine-tuned specifically for academic English-to-Telugu translation. It ensures accurate representation of technical terms and preserves the context of the original content.  

### **Features**  
- High-quality, domain-specific translations tailored for academic use.  
- Reliable fine-tuning on curated datasets for precision and fluency.
